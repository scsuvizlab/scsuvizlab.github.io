    "content": "<p>The restaurant smelled right. Wood and spices and actual fire. No sanitized air. No temperature perfectly calibrated for optimal dining experience. Just heat from a kitchen where humans cooked food.</p>\n\n<p>Zach had done well. The boy had always been practical, even when studying engineering. Now he'd built this place that didn't need to exist. Brass fixtures salvaged from buildings marked for algorithmic efficiency upgrades. Tables with wear marks from actual use. Chairs that didn't match. None of it optimized.</p>\n\n<p>Nicole checked her wrist display before she even looked at the restaurant. Always connected. Always half somewhere else. Her generation thought that was normal. Mine knew better.</p>\n\n<p>\"Well? What do you think?\" Zach asked, arms spread wide. Nervous. Wanting approval.</p>\n\n<p>\"Place looks expensive,\" I said. Didn't say: It looks like the past. Like somewhere that might have existed before everything went to hell. Before machines started telling us what we needed before we knew we needed it.</p>\n\n<p>Alec slunk in behind his mother. Head down. Shoulders hunched. These kids were born with surveillance. Grew up with it. Never knew what it was like to be truly alone with your thoughts. The boy moved like prey. Always aware of being watched.</p>\n\n<p>We sat. The chair was uneven. One leg slightly shorter than the others. Wouldn't have passed quality control in the new world. Perfect.</p>\n\n<p>A waiter approached. Young man. Not a servitor. Human. Had a name tag that said \"Rhett.\" Carried a wooden tray with actual food on it. Hadn't been delivered by drone or fabricated on-site by a molecular assembler.</p>\n\n<p>\"Tonight's first offering,\" he said with a real grin, not an algorithm-approved customer satisfaction expression, \"is a fusion of tradition and rebellion: smoked lamb belly with saffron miso glaze, served over grits infused with black garlic and lab-grown truffle oil.\" He leaned closer. \"Every element of this dish was touched by human hands. No robots, no AI-guided plating. Just intuition and craftsmanship.\"</p>\n\n<p>The speech was rehearsed but genuine. The kid believed it. Good.</p>\n\n<p>Nicole barely looked up from whatever data was streaming across her display. Always working. Always connected to that system she was building. The one that would make human decision-making obsolete.</p>\n\n<p>\"You know, Zach,\" she said, \"you could double your output with just two humanoid models in the kitchen. Cut down on inconsistency, too.\"</p>\n\n<p>Missed the point completely. Always did.</p>\n\n<p>Zach cut into his lamb. \"That's the whole point, Nic. People don't come here for efficiency. They come here because they're hungry for something they can't get anywhere else.\" He looked at me. Seeking alliance. \"They're hungry for love in the process. And I swear, you can taste the difference.\"</p>\n\n<p>He was right. The food tasted like food should. Not optimized for perfect nutritional balance or calibrated flavor profiles. Just good.</p>\n\n<p>\"Damn right you can,\" I said, meaning it. Gestured at Rhett with my fork. \"Kid's got the right idea. The world's all smooth edges now. No grit, no fight, no craft. This?\" I raised my plate slightly. \"This has fight.\"</p>\n\n<p>Alec pushed food around his plate. \"It's good, Dad. Just... weird.\" His smile was forced. \"But I hope it works out for you.\"</p>\n\n<p>The boy didn't get it. Couldn't. Never knew a world without AI. Never made something with his hands just because. Never flew a plane by feel.</p>\n\n<p>The lamb was good. Grits too. Hadn't had proper grits in years. The automated food dispensaries didn't make them right. Too consistent. No texture.</p>\n\n<p>\"You remember what it was like to be an artist, don't you?\" Zach asked Nicole. Trying to reach her. Trying to pull her back to the physical world.</p>\n\n<p>\"I never stopped being one,\" she said. \"I just found a bigger canvas.\"</p>\n\n<p>Bullshit. She'd stopped making real things years ago. Now she just built systems that controlled people's lives without them knowing it. Called it governance. Called it efficiency. Was still control.</p>\n\n<p>\"Yeah, yeah. You build AIs that run the world. Hell of a masterpiece.\" Couldn't keep the bitterness out. Didn't try.</p>\n\n<p>Nicole kept eating. Precise movements. Measured bites. \"Governance isn't about control, Steve. It's about efficiency.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Efficiency is just control with better PR.\" I set down my fork. Looked her in the eye. \"And the bigger the system, the more people it forgets about.\"</p>\n\n<p>The table went quiet. Staff moved around the restaurant. Preparing for opening. Doing real work. Being human.</p>\n\n<p>Something bothered me about all this. Didn't add up. I tapped my fork against the plate. Thinking.</p>\n\n<p>\"You know what I don't get? How does this even work? You don't have a job, Zach. Haven't had one in fifteen years. Nobody here is getting paid, and the food's free. So what the hell is keeping the lights on?\"</p>\n\n<p>Zach started to answer. Hesitated. Looking around the room like he was seeing it for the first time. Remembering why he built it. I knew that look. Had seen it in pilots first time they flew solo. The moment when theory meets reality.</p>\n\n<p>Nicole jumped in. Always ready with an explanation. \"It's not about money, Steve. It's about demand. We're building a new system, one based on societal need rather than the exchange of arbitrary currency. People want this place to exist, so it does. The value isn't in profitâ€”it's in providing something that society wants.\"</p>\n\n<p>More system talk. More optimization. More algorithms deciding what should and shouldn't exist. What had value. What didn't.</p>\n\n<p>\"That sounds like a whole lot of nothing wrapped up in a nice speech.\"</p>\n\n<p>Nicole smirked. Thought I was too old to understand. Too analog. \"That's because you're still thinking in old-world terms. We're still figuring it out, but what we're doing here? It's the start of something different. Something better.\"</p>\n\n<p>Maybe. Maybe not. The world had been ending since I was born. Nuclear war. Climate collapse. Social media apocalypse. AI revolution. Everyone always thought they were building something better.</p>\n\n<p>I noticed Alec's hand slip into his pocket. Quick movement. Furtive. Then back to pushing food around his plate. Kid was hiding something. Recognized the look from my own youth. From rookies trying to cover mistakes in the cockpit.</p>\n\n<p>Made a mental note to watch the boy. Something wasn't right there.</p>\n\n<p>The food was getting cold. Didn't matter. Appetite gone anyway. The conversation had soured it. Always did when Nicole started talking about her brave new world.</p>\n\n<p>This restaurant was good. Real. But it existed because the system allowed it to. Because it served some purpose in Nicole's grand design. A pressure valve. A controlled rebellion.</p>\n\n<p>Zach didn't see that. He thought he was building something independent. Something free.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing was free anymore. Nothing was independent. Everything was connected. Monitored. Optimized.</p>\n\n<p>Even this.</p>\n\n<p>\"More wine?\" Zach asked, reaching for the bottle. Real glass. Real liquid. Probably the last real wine in Atlanta.</p>\n\n<p>I nodded. Let him pour. Didn't say anything else.</p>\n\n<p>Some fights weren't worth having. Not tonight. Tonight was for Zach and his beautiful, doomed rebellion of a restaurant.</p>\n\n<p>I raised the glass slightly. A silent toast to things that wouldn't last.</p>"
