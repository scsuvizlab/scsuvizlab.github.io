# Explorations in the New Media Paradigm - Enhanced Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive architecture for "Explorations in the New Media Paradigm," an interactive book with dual fiction and non-fiction tracks. The system enables multiple forms of reader agency through a modular, node-based content structure.

## Core Design Principles

1. **Reader Agency**: Allow readers to determine their path through the content
2. **Modular Structure**: Discrete content nodes that can be navigated non-linearly
3. **Dynamic Depth**: Multiple layers of narrative detail accessible based on reader interest
4. **Dual Tracks**: Fiction and non-fiction components that complement each other
5. **AI Expandability**: Structured data that enables AI to generate consistent, contextual content
6. **Media Integration**: Support for text, audio, and visual elements

## Node Types and Visual System

The system utilizes five distinct node types, each with a specific purpose and visual representation:

### 1. Fiction Node

### Branch Point Connections (Orange)
- Create narrative diversions from the main path
- May be temporary (return to original path) or extended (follow new path)
- Often follow secondary characters or explore side stories

### Concept Sequence Connections (Purple)
- Connect non-fiction nodes in educational sequence
- Define the default learning path
- Organized by conceptual complexity

### Related Concept Connections (Green)
- Link related non-fiction topics
- Create a web of knowledge connections
